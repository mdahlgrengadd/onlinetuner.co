This is a form of [www.onlinetuner.co](http://www.onlinetuner.co). I needed a tuner with which I could specify certain keys to favour in the tuning process, instead of just using equal temperament. For instance, I play mostly in the key of A, D, G, E... so with this tuner you can mark those keys and they will sound better than for instance the key of Bb. If you mark all keyes it will be the same as equal temperament tuning. 

I'm not sure if the maths is at all correct, but it seems to work pretty well. Try it out and let me now if theres something wrong in the code...
